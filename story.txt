One time in my chemistry class, while the teacher was talking, this guy asked loudly, “Does anyone have any lotion?” The teacher stopped talking as some girl gave him some hand lotion.  
The guy asked what brand the hand lotion is. But, she did not answer him. All she did was smiling suspiciously.

The guy decided not to actually use the hand lotion. Probably because it was pretty weird that this girl wasn't answering him about what it actually was.

He started to wonder what could have been in the lotion. Was this girl trying to poison him? That doesn't make much sense because he just met her, and she has no reason to want to cause
him harm. Unless she knows what he did to George last week.
