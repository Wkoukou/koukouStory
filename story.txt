One time in my chemistry class, while the teacher was talking, this guy asked loudly, “Does anyone have any lotion?” The teacher stopped talking as some girl gave him some hand lotion.  
The guy asked what brand the hand lotion is. But, she did not answer him. All she did was smiling suspiciously.

The guy decided not to actually use the hand lotion. Probably because it was pretty weird that this girl wasn't answering him about what it actually was.

He started to wonder what could have been in the lotion. Was this girl trying to poison him? That doesn't make much sense because he just met her, and she has no reason to want to cause
him harm. Unless she knows what he did to George last week.

It turns out that, last week, this same guy decided to put itching powder in George's lotion. Because of this, the girl was trying to do the same to him as a form of revenge. Luckily, he realized what was going on and threw the lotion in the trash.

His feeling was true. That girl is Gerogr's sister to help him to do the revenge. However, Geroge's revenge did not work. He would still try his trick to revenge.
