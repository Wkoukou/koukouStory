One time in my chemistry class, while the teacher was talking, this guy asked loudly, “Does anyone have any lotion?” The teacher stopped talking as some girl gave him some hand lotion.  
The guy asked what brand the hand lotion is. But, she did not answer him. All she did was smiling suspiciously.

The guy decided not to actually use the hand lotion. Probably because it was pretty weird that this girl wasn't answering him about what it actually was.
